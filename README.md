# SIGN-LANGUAGE-DETECTION

This notebook is part of my Microsoft internship project, where I've developed a sign language detection system using a YOLOv8 model. The notebook facilitates real-time capture and classification of hand gestures, focusing on the labels 'hello', 'thanks', 'yes', 'no', and 'iloveyou'. For each label, Iâ€™ve collected 15 images to train the model. The project is also optimized to run in PyCharm, enabling seamless real-time detection and classification of sign language gestures.
